## 12. IATelligence
- URL - https://github.com/fr0gger/IATelligence
- IATelligence is a Python script that extracts the Import Address Table (IAT) from a PE file and uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide details about each Windows API imported by the file. The script also searches for related MITRE ATT&CK techniques and explains how the API could potentially be used by attackers.
- It also displays the hashes of the file and estimates the cost of the GPT-3 requests. IATelligence is a proof of concept for using GPT-3 for malware analysis and quickly assessing the behavior of a malware based on its IAT.
